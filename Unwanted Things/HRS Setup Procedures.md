##High Rate Sedimentation: Experimental Setup Procedures
Updated July 2018

1. Drain the sedimentation tank.
   a. Close the valves that would allow backflow into the sedimentation tankâ€™s effluent tube. Disconnect that tube.
   b. Close the valve between the flocculator and sed tank.
   c. Open the valve that drains the sed tank from the bottom.
   d. Disconnect the tube attached to the floc weir and catch the draining fluid in a waste bucket or tub.
   e. Reconnect the tube to the floc weir. Turn on the waste pump to drain the floc weir throughout the rest of the setup.
     * The waste pump should be controlled by ProCoDA, so turning it on may require turning on ProCoDA and then manually disabling other pumps.

2. Clean the flocculator and sedimentation tank.
   a. Close values leading to the flocculator.
   b. Take the disconnected effluent tube (see step 1) and connect it to end of the flocculator.
   c. Connect one end of a long cleaning tube to the system just before the **coagulant entry point**.
   d. Connect the other end of the cleaning tube to the sink and turn on the faucet slowly. Make sure that the water is not rising more than a couple inches from the bottom of the sed tank. Continue for 30 seconds.

3. Clean out the flocculator in the reverse direction.
   a. Just before the coagulant entry point, swap the cleaning tube for another tube long enough to reach a waste bucket or tub. This can be a new tube or, as shown in the diagram, the waste tube that drains the sedimentation tank.
   b. Connect the cleaning tube to the end of the flocculator.
   c. Turn on the sink faucet and gradually accelerate the water speed. This can reach a higher speed than in Step 2, though not high enough for the faucet to  start spraying water.
   d. Turn off the faucet and redo all connections that were modified in Steps 1-3.

4. Clean out the pressure attenuator if there seems to be clay inside.
   a. Close valves on either side of the pressure attenuator.
   b. If there is water inside the pressure attenuator bottle, turn it upside down (so water does not spill out) and remove the tubes connected to the inlets and outlets.
   c. Pour out the contents and rinse the bottle.
   d. Add enough water to cover the inlet and outlet holes, screw the cap on, turn the bottle upside down again, and insert the tubes back into the inlets and outlets.

5. Disconnect the coagulant tube from system, turn on the pump, and check that coagulant is running through. If it is, reconnect the tube to the system.
   * Make sure the coagulant valve is open. There should be steady drops of solution.

6. Run water through the system while bypassing the pressure attenuator.
   * While waiting for one of the longer steps of the setup to complete (such as this step), start making the coagulant and clay stocks.

7. After the water reaches the top of the sed tank, shut off the water pump and drain the sedimentation tank again.
   * Repeat steps 5 and 6 about two to three more times to achieve a more thorough cleaning of the sed tank.

8. Run water only through the system _with_ the pressure attenuator included until effluent turbidity stabilizes near 0 NTU (ideally below 1.0 NTU). It is natural for influent and effluent turbidity to rise at first in this step.
   *  Troubleshooting Pressure Buildup
      * If the water level is rising steadily in the pressure attenuator (and it was already above the outlet), there is still pressure buildup in the system, most likely due to a closed valve or air in the tubing.
      * If there may be air, redirect flow to waste instead of the flocculator (after the influent turbidimeter) until the pressure stabilizes.

9. Clean out the influent and effluent turbidimeters.
   a. Even without water running, shut and open the appropriate values to bypass the turbidimeter so that water doesn't leak into it while cleaning
   b. Unlock and take out the black cylinder on top of the turbidimeter.
   c. Unscrew the glass vial, empty and rinse it, then fill it with clean water. Tap water is sufficient.
   d. Screw the vial back in, wipe the bottle and cylinder free from water droplets or fingerprints, and then lock the black cylinder back into the turbidimeter.
   e. If you used the white screws on the outflow turbidimeter tubes to block water passage, remember to unscrew them.

10. Direct the flow to waste instead of the flocculator as shown in the diagram below.

11. Turn the clay stirrer and ProCoDa on and stabilize influent turbidity to 100 NTU, which should take about 10-15 minutes.

12. Redirect the flow back to the flocculator and main system. Turn on the coagulant pump to start the experiment.
